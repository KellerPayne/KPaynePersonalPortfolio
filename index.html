                    <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio website!</p>
                    <p>My name is Keller Payne, and I am 30 years old. I am a senior in Computer Science at the University of New Orleans. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and plan to graduate by December 2025.</p>
                    <p>My background is quite a journey! I graduated with my first degree in 2017 from Southeastern Louisiana University in Middle School Math and Science Education. I then worked in 4 different schools between Amite City, Louisiana and Gretna, Louisiana over the course of the next seven years. I taught 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade math and also 4th and 8th grade science. During this time, I also acted as the 5th-8th grade Math Department Chair at Amite Westside Middle Magnet School during my second year teaching, Web-Master for both Amite Westside Middle Magnet School during my second year and George Cox Elementary during my 7th year. I also served as the School-Based Technology Coordinator for George Cox Elementary during my 6th and 7th year. With these positions, I developed many useful skills that are transferrable among many professions.</p>
                    <p>These skills include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Management,</li>
                        <li>Effective and Professional Communication,</li>
                        <li>Emotional Intelligence,</li>
                        <li>Leadership,</li>
                        <li>Critical Thinking,</li>
                        <li>Adaptability,</li>
                        <li>Multitasking,</li>
                        <li>Organization, and</li>
                        <li>Conflict Resolution.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I decided near the middle of my 6th year to return to school to pursue a second degree in Computer Science. In June 2023, I began taking prerequisite classes at Delgado Community College, and continued taking these classes online throughout the beginning of my seventh year of teaching while I was still in the classroom. It was at this time that I realized how determined I was since I was able to handle the responsibilities of teaching while also taking classes in the afternoon and maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I decided at the end of the Fall 2023 semester to leave teaching and enroll full-time at the University of New Orleans.</p>
                    <p>Since beginning classes at UNO, I have learned how to program using Java proficiently. I also learned about Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. During the upcoming Spring 2025 semester, I will cover Computer Networks, Computer Graphics, Algorithm Analysis, the Theory of Computation, Systems Programming Concepts, Telecommunications, and Programming Language Structure. Before I enrolled at UNO, I took several courses on Codecademy and freeCodeCamp.org and learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and so much more. Each of my certificates of completion can be seen in my shared GoogleDrive folder provided in the header of this website.</p>

                        <h5 class="font-weight-light">Includes coursework completed at UNO. All code can be found in the linked GoogleDrive folder at the top of this page.</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Number Guessing Game <span class="font-weight-light"> Utilizes java.util.Random, takes user input, and produces output</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Array Manipulation with Method Overloading <span class="font-weight-light">Manipulates an array of integers through specific arithmetic operations including addition, multiplication, and division. Uses method overloading to provide flexibility in how operations are applied based on different conditions.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Car Management System <span class="font-weight-light"> Practice of Java object-oriented programming concepts. Created a "Car" class with constructors, setters, getters, and some basic validation checks.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Task Tracker (Part 1) <span class="font-weight-light">Created a foundation for a simple to-do list application called TaskTracker. Implemented a DateAndTimeCombo class representing the idea of a specific time on a specific date. Used DateAndTimeCombo class to implement a SimpleTask class. Generated Javadocs and JUnit tests for DateAndTimeCombo as well as SimpleTask.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Task Tracker (Part 2) <span class="font-weight-light">Modified DateAndTimeCombo so that it implemented Comparable interface. Implemented a compareTo method and overrode Equals so that it compares underlying date and time variable for equality. Implemented a new CompoundTask class, which contains components that consists of SimpleTask objects. Modified both of these classes so that they were subclasses of an abstract task called Task. Generated Javadocs and Junit tests for all classes implemented.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Recursion in Java <span class="font-weight-light">Implemented two recursive methods, compare() and findMinimum(). compare() compares two Strings using alphabetical order as the natural order. Returns -1 if s1 comes before s2. Returns 0 of s1 is indistinguishable from s2. Returns 1 if s1 comes after s2. In findMinimum(), uses the compare() method to find the minimum String in an array of Strings given the array and the number of Strings in the array. Created JUnit tests for each of these method implementations.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Lists and Iterators <span class="font-weight-light">Created an implementation of a Doubly Linked List. This class contained nested Iterator class and Node class. Wrote JUnit tests for all classes and methods.</span></li>
                            <li class="font-weight-bold">Map Implementation <span class="font-weight-light">Created a Map implementation such that the map stores its key, value pairs as MapEntry objects in an underlying SeparateChainingHashTable. Wrote JUnit tests for all methods.</span></li>
