                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Keller Payne. I am 30 years old. And I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of New Orleans. My expected graduation date is December 2025.</p>
                <p>I earned my first degree in 2017 from Southeastern Louisiana University. I majored in Middle School Education with concentrations in Mathematics and Science. This led me on the path to becoming my school's Technology Coordinator, which eventually brought me to coding.</p>
                <p>After being introduced to coding while handling my school's website, I found a passion in the intricate details of different coding languages, and eventually enrolled at Delgado Community College in May of 2023 to begin fulfilling undergraduate coursework for a degree in Computer Science that were not fulfilled with my teaching degree. In December of 2023, I left teaching after 7 years in the classroom to enroll full time at the University of New Orleans.</p>
                <p>In my time at the University of New Orleans, I have gained knowledge and hands-on experience with Java programming concepts. These concepts include OOP best practices, conditionals and control flow, Arrays and ArrayLists, loops, scope, inheritance and polymorphism, object types, method overloading and overriding, typecasting, exception handling, Javadocumentation, JUnit testing, serialization, direct and indirect recursion, generics, inner and anonymous classes, searching and sorting, Big-O notation, Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis. I also gained experience with MASM x86 Assembly Language, however I wouldn't necessarily say I prefer MASM over Java. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA and intend on continuing to do so throughout the duration of my senior year.</p>
